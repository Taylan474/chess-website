# Real-Time Chess Game

A simple real-time multiplayer chess app built with React, Node.js, and Socket.IO. This project supports real-time communication between two players in the same match â€” no backend database, no lobby, just pure chess.

# Demo

Two players can play in real-time with synchronized moves and resign detection.

# Getting Started

**Note: Requires Node.js version 18. You can use nvm to manage multiple Node versions.**

1. Start the Server

```
cd chess-serverSide
npm install
npm audit fix --force
npm start
```

The server will run on port 5000.

2. Start the Client

Open a second terminal and run:
